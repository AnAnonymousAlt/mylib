Observation:
Some condition cannot be met in RBTree
When deteting node, we see this as two steps:
    First, exchange a node with this one.
    Second, delete the exchanged one.
I have to rewrite whole code to make the leaf node a node rather than a NULL pointer to make recurtion in deletion writable.
So, write note is very important. It can save lots of time, instead of waste time.
RBTree is really a huge proj.
